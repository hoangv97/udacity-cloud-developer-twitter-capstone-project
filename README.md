# Serverless Twitter Application

Serverless Twitter application where a user can create a tweet and upload their images.

## How to run the application

### Backend

To deploy an application run the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy -v
```

### Frontend

To run a client application first edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters. And then run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless Twitter application.
